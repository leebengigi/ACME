## Design Decisions & Algorithm Description

The system employs a hybrid approach combining traditional ML with LLM-based analysis for security request processing:

### Core Components
1. **Adaptive Decision Engine**
   - Ensemble of ML models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression)
   - Dynamic threshold adjustment based on risk assessment
   - Confidence-based decision routing

2. **Risk Assessment System**
   - Multi-factor risk scoring (1-10 scale)
   - Contextual analysis of request content
   - Historical pattern recognition

3. **Classification Service**
   - TF-IDF based text analysis
   - Request type categorization
   - Confidence scoring for predictions

### Key Design Decisions
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Combines rule-based, ML, and LLM approaches for robust decision-making
- **Adaptive Thresholds**: Dynamic risk thresholds based on historical data and request context
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Multiple layers of fallback to ensure system reliability
- **Data Augmentation**: Synthetic data generation to address class imbalance
- **Feature Engineering**: Comprehensive text and metadata feature extraction

### Algorithm Flow
1. Request received → Text preprocessing and feature extraction
2. Initial classification → Request type identification
3. Risk assessment → Multi-factor risk scoring
4. Decision making → Ensemble model prediction with confidence scoring
5. Safety checks → Rule-based validation and consistency checks
6. Final decision → Outcome determination with rationale

The system prioritizes security while maintaining efficiency through automated processing of common cases and human review for high-risk or ambiguous requests.
